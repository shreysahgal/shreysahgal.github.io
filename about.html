    <div id="bio">
        <p align="justify"> I'm Shrey Sahgal, a junior at Horace Mann School in the Bronx, NY. Over the past few years, I have developed an interest in STEM and, specifically, computer science. At the bottom of this page you can find my résumé which details my academic/extracurricular studies. This About Me page is to describe who I am rather than just what I do.
        <p align="justify">
        I read/write/speak English (obviously) as well as Spanish, and I can speak Hindi (in fact it was my first language), but I never learned to read/write it. I also really like video games, and recently I have been playing a lot of Overwatch and Super Smash Bros Ultimate. I also really enjoy listening to music of all types. My Spotify account has a lot of playlists with random names for different times/moods, and can be found <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/lordoftheshreys?si=GRW6U2k6R-Gp-VfQa40aeA">here</a>. Thanks for reading, and feel free to take a look at my résumé to find out more about me!
